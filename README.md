## Installation

#### Git clone this repository.

#### Navigate to application folder.

#### In a terminal, run the following command to install all necessary modules.

`npm install`

- Create a `.env` file in the root folder.
- Inside `.env` create:

`SESSION_SECRET=`

Write any secret phrase you wish to utilize as a secret session storage. Make sure to keep it secure once you have saved it to the file.

`MONGODB_URI=`

Use this to write down your MongoDB url. If using a local instance of MongoDB that would look something like:

`MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/<database-name-here>"`

If using MongoDB Atlas instance, then write your link located in your Atlas dashboard along with your credentials inside the link.

For the Slack Webhook, go to the `Review.js` file inside the `src/Components` folder and set the `webhookUrl` value the webhook provided by Slack.

## Usage

Make sure that your MongoDB instance is working by running the command

`mongosh`

If working with MongoDB Atlas, run

`mongosh "mongodb+srv://<your-cluster-information-here>" --username <your-username-here>`

To run the application locally first run:

`npm run start-app`

After the server has come up, open a browser at:

`http://localhost:3000`

#### Enjoy the app!
